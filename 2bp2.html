		<strong>
		<p class= "double">
			My goal is to actively investigate various pathways in bioinformatics through research
			and hands-on experience. I am dedicated to pursuing my academic goals and will accomplish this by exploring
			opportunities to gain practical research insights, and cultivating collaborative partnerships with mentors 
			and peers. By doing so, I hope to constantly broaden my knowledge base and skill in biological data processing,
			taking significant steps toward attaining my vision.
