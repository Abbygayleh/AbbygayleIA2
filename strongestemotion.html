				Having a cheerful disposition helps me academically in many ways. 
				Such ways are the following:

			<ul type= "square">
				<li>
				A cheerful nature frequently draws friends and peers towards. 
				When it comes to studying, group projects, or seeking aid with academics, 
				I am able to turn to these peers that are willing to provide invaluable support 
				and assistance. The same goes with professors. 	
				</li>

				Being a jovial individual also sometimes increases my motivation to learn. 
				I realize that I may be motivated to attend classes, participate in discussions, 
				and complete projects because I see them as possibilities for enjoyment and personal 
				improvement based on what I wish to specialize in.
