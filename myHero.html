			My favourite quote from Yumeko Jabami is found in episode 2 of the series. 
			The quote is “I'm not crazy. I'm just ahead of the curve.” This can be perceived 
			as breaking away from conventional thinking or standards to pursue one's passions 
			and aspirations is also being ahead of the general public. One does not always have 
			to follow a traditional way to achieve their goals. Many of us are different and arrive
			at our answers in different ways.
