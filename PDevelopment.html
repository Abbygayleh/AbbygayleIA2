		<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
		<p style= "text-indent: 5%;">
			Summary:
			<p style= "text-indent: 10%;" class= "double">
			In Chapter 4, Michael shows worry about his professional life, 
			feeling as though he isn't reaching his full potential. 
			Charlie teaches the concept of goal-setting and stresses the
			significance of having specific objectives in life. Charlie then
			suggests that Michael put his goals in writing because doing so helps 
			one become conscious of their goals and motivates them to be achieved.
			</p>
			</br>
		</p>
		<p style= "text-indent: 5%;">
			Application to my life:
			<p style= "text-indent: 10%;" class= "double">
			I would start by identifying my goals by listing both short and long-term 
			objectives for my profession, education, personal development, and the list goes on. 
			I would then do as Charlie advised which is writing down my goals. I would be as clear 
			as I can about what I hope to accomplish and when. Lastly, I would keep my objectives in sight,
			possibly by displaying them somewhere I'll see them frequently in order to stay motivated and to
			remind myself of the reasons I originally established these goals.
			</p>
			</br>
		</p>
		
		</br>
		
		<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
		<p style= "text-indent: 5%;">
			Summary:
			<p style= "text-indent: 10%;" class= "double">
			In Chapter 5, time management is the topic of a conversation between Sue,
			Charlie, and Michael. Charlie explains the value of setting objectives and 
			making the most of every day to Michael, who is feeling burdened with his career
			and life. Charlie quotes Mr. Davis as saying that people must make a decision between
			the "pain of discipline" and the "pain of regret," and that they must master time by
			creating their own life plans as opposed to allowing time to control them. Charlie is
			thanked by Michael, who also makes a commitment to return to him shortly.
			</p>
			</br>
		</p>
		<p style= "text-indent: 5%;">
			Application to my life:
			<p style= "text-indent: 10%;" class= "double">
			I would develop discipline by accepting the "pain of discipline" by following my timetable 
			and abstaining from procrastinating. I would recognize that over time, little, persistent efforts 
			add up. Reflect on my regrets and use the "pain of regret" as motivation to take focused action. 
			I would think about how I would feel if I didn't pursue your objectives. In addition to this, I would
			make a daily timetable or to-do list that supports my life strategy and also set up defined time periods
			for jobs and activities, making sure they advance my goals. The most important part of this all is for me
			to be willing to apply these principles, just as how Charlie portrayed this trait throughout chapters 4-7.

		<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
		<p style= "text-indent: 5%;">
			Summary:
			<p style= "text-indent: 10%;" class= "double">
			In Chapter 6, Michael visited Charlie at Twelve Pillars sharing wonderful news.
			The news stated that his wife and he were getting better, and he had made a list of
			100 life goals. The third Pillar of Success is to surround oneself with the finest people,
			not simply the best things, Charlie informed Michael. 
			</p>
		</p>
		<p style= "text-indent: 5%;">
			Application to my life:
			<p style= "text-indent: 10%;" class= "double">
			My life may be positively affected by surrounding oneself with uplifting, encouraging, 
			and growth-minded people. This is so because my goals and decisions are greatly influenced 
			by people in my social circle. With that being said, I would ensure that I surround myself with
			positive and supportive people. By doing this I would also consider whether my pals are advancing 
			my development, learning, and pursuit of my objectives or impeding it.
			</p>
			</br>

		<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
		<p style= "text-indent: 5%;">
			Summary:
			<p style= "text-indent: 10%;" class= "double">
			In Chapter 7, Michael and Charlie were having a conversation about the value of lifetime
			learning while Charlie is adding chemicals to a swimming pool. Charlie emphasises that formal 
			schooling is not the be all and end all, citing Mr. Davis' "Pillar of Success" that a successful 
			person is always a life-long earner. He says that self-education, which includes reading books, 
			seeing successful people, and thinking back on one's own experiences, is essential for success. 
			Charlie mentioned that a significant portion of the issue in today’s world is that people don't read 
			books. He contends that books are one of the best sources of knowledge today and in the future, and that
			they are priceless.
			</p>
		</p>
		<p style= "text-indent: 5%;">
			Application to my life:
			<p style= "text-indent: 10%;" class= "double">
			This conversation has taught me the value of lifelong learning and the importance of reading books.
			In order to apply this lesson to my life I would have to not limit myself when it comes to education. 
			I will look for information from a variety of sources, such as books, prosperous people, experiences, and
			online resources. I would also dedicate my time to read books every now and then since reading books can broaden
			my perspective, promote critical thought, and give me a sense of accomplishment.
