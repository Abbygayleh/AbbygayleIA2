		<p>
			I like to engage in activities that involves sports, such as swimming 
			and badminton or even going to the gym. This improves my overall health 
			and fitness, which in turn increases my overall energy, reduces stress, 
			increases concentration, and memory. This all contributes to my academic 
			performance.
