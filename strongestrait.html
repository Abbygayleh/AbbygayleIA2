				Discipline is an attribute that has a significant impact on my academic success. 
				This is so because I stick to study schedules, fulfil deadlines, and stay organized 
				which in turn prevents me from being stressed out in the long run. Being discipline 
				assists me to avoid procrastination and maintain a regular work ethic, which leads to 
				higher marks and a better knowledge of the topic being taught.
